This is an exploratory data analysis of Lebron James' shots over the last 20 years (2003-2023)

Why the focus on Lebron James you may be wondering? Well, its pretty simple:

1.  He's arguably one of the greatest basketball players the world has ever seen (its a race between him and Michael Jordan for the top spot)
2.  As of 2023, he is the NBA's all-time leading scorer, surpasing Karim Abdul Jabbar
3.  I've been a Laker's fan , and Lebron will go down as one of the Laker greats, like Kobe Bryant, James Worthy and Magic Johnson.

**The key question we're trying to answer is whether Lebron's shot choices have also evolved, as the league has evolved? As the league has shifted to more 3-PT shooting, has Lebron also adjusted his shot choices accordingly?**

We're going to explore this shot evolution in the following steps:

1.  **Data Acquisition**:

    -   Retrieve LeBron's shot data for all seasons (2003–2023).

    -   Filter the data to include only LeBron James.

2.  **Data Preparation**:

    -   Add a column for `season`.

    -   Categorize shots into specific court zones (e.g., 3PT, mid-range, paint).

    -   Summarize the frequency of shots taken from each zone by season.

3.  **Visualization**:

    -   Create a heatmap or faceted plots to show changes in shot frequency by court zones over time.

# Data acquisition

# The goal here it to get shot data for all LBJ teams from 2003 to 2023

# Using a for-loop for each team and season lebron played in

# Team 1: Starting with the Cleveland Cavaliers

# Initialize an empty list to store shot data for each season
all_shots_cc <- list()

# Loop through each season from 2003 to 2010
for (season in 2003:2010) {
  # Fetch shot data for the current season
  season_shots_cc <- teams_shots(team_ids = 1610612739, seasons = season)
  
  # Append the data to the list
  all_shots_cc[[as.character(season)]] <- season_shots_cc
}

# Combine all cav seasons data into a single data frame
shots_cc <- bind_rows(all_shots_cc)

# Team 2: Miami Heat
all_shots_mh <- list()

# Loop through each season from 2003 to 2010
for (season in 2011:2014) {
  # Fetch shot data for the current season
  season_shots_mh <- teams_shots(team_ids = 1610612748, seasons = season)
  
  # Append the data to the list
  all_shots_mh[[as.character(season)]] <- season_shots_mh
}

# Combine all miami seasons data into a single data frame
shots_mh <- bind_rows(all_shots_mh)

# Team 3: Back to the Cavs

# Initialize an empty list to store shot data for each season
all_shots_cc2 <- list()

# Loop through each season from 2015 to 2018
for (season in 2015:2018) {
  # Fetch shot data for the current season
  season_shots_cc2 <- teams_shots(team_ids = 1610612739, seasons = season)
  
  # Append the data to the list
  all_shots_cc2[[as.character(season)]] <- season_shots_cc2
}

# Combine all cavs seasons data into a single data frame
shots_cc2 <- bind_rows(all_shots_cc2)

# Team 4/Current Team: The LosAngeles Lakers

# Initialize an empty list to store shot data for each season
all_shots_ll <- list()

# Loop through each season from 2015 to 2018
for (season in 2019:2023) {
  # Fetch shot data for the current season
  season_shots_ll <- teams_shots(team_ids = 1610612747, seasons = season)
  
  # Append the data to the list
  all_shots_ll[[as.character(season)]] <- season_shots_ll
}

# Combine all laker seasons data into a single data frame
shots_ll <- bind_rows(all_shots_ll)

# Combine all shots data frames above into one main data frame (to rule them all, haha)
shots <- rbind(shots_cc, shots_mh, shots_cc2, shots_ll)

# Filter only LeBron James' shots
lebron_shots <- shots |>
  filter(namePlayer == "LeBron James") |>
  mutate(season = as.factor(yearSeason))  # Add a season column

```

....

# Data preparation

## Let's now categorize his shots by court zone

```{r}


# Define zones based on shot locations
lebron_shots <- lebron_shots |>
  # Scale x and y coordinates (court dimensions adjusted manually)
  mutate(x = (locationX / 10) - 0,
         y = (locationY / 10) - 41.75) |>
  mutate(
    # Categorize shots based on distance from the basket
    court_zone = case_when(
      distanceShot <= 8 ~ "Paint",               # Shots close to the basket
      distanceShot > 8 & distanceShot < 23 ~ "Mid-Range",  # Shots outside the paint but inside the 3PT line
      distanceShot >= 23 ~ "3PT",                # Shots beyond the 3-point line
      TRUE ~ "Other"                            # Catch-all for undefined cases
    )
  )

```

...

## Next, we summarize Lebron's shot frequencies by zone and season

```{r}
# Group by season and court zone, then summarize frequencies

lebron_summary <- lebron_shots |>
  group_by(season, court_zone) |>
  summarize(total_shots = n(), .groups = "drop") |>
  group_by(season) |>
  mutate(
    overall_shots = sum(total_shots),  # Calculate overall shots per season
    percentage = (total_shots / overall_shots) * 100  # Calculate percentage by court zone
  ) |>
  ungroup()


```

...

# Visualization

## Option 1: Let's first create a heatmap of shotzones over time

```{r}

# Heatmap to show shot preferences over time
ggplot(lebron_summary, aes(x = season, y = court_zone, fill = percentage)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red", name = "Shot %") +
  labs(
    title = "Evolution of LeBron James' Shot Choices (2003–2023)",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Court Zone"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

```

....

## Option 2: Facet line chart of shot zones over-time

...

```{r}
# Faceted line plot for shot preferences
ggplot(lebron_summary, aes(x = season, y = percentage, color = court_zone, group = court_zone)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "LeBron James' Shot Choices Over Time",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Percentage of Shots",
    color = "Court Zone"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))


```

...

## Option 3: Shot zones on an NBA half court

...

```{r}

# Add a season column as a factor for animation
lebron_shots <- lebron_shots |>
  mutate(season = as.factor(season))

# Create the shot zones visualization
shot_zones_halfcourt <- 
  
  # Add NBA halfcourt
  BasketballAnalyzeR::drawNBAcourt(ggplot(data = lebron_shots), size = 0.5, col = "grey20") +
  
  # Add shot locations
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = court_zone),alpha = 0.7, shape = 21, size = 2, color = "black") +
  
  # Customize color scale for court zones
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("Paint" = "#FF9999", "Mid-Range" = "#99CCFF", "3PT" = "#FFCC99"),
    name = "Court Zone"
  ) +
  
  # Animation: One frame per season
  transition_states(season, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "LeBron James Shot Zones by Season: {closest_state}",
    subtitle = "Visualizing the evolution of shot zones (2003–2023)",
    x = "Court Width (scaled)",
    y = "Court Length (scaled)",
    caption = "Data Source: nbastatR"
  ) +
  
  # Customize theme
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10)
  )

# Save the animation
#anim_save("lebron_shot_zones.gif", shot_zones_halfcourt)

```
